# UTM Hacklab Android Workshop #1

At the first UTM Hacklab Android workshop, we built a simple todolist app!

### Ideas for improving the app
##### Think of this as homework...but not really homework  

 - Add a listener for the checkbox to remove a todo when completed. 
 - Display toast notifications when todos are added or completed 
 - Instead of removing a todo when checked, dim the card's background color
